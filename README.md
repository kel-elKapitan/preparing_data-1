Background

Presented is 3 methods for cleaning data that gets progressively more difficult but enriches the dataset by the availability of more features while retaining the maximum number of records.

The dataset is taken from carguru dataset provided by https://www.kaggle.com/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset.

This analysis is based purely in Python 3.11.9 inside a Jupyter Notebook.

Modlues used are:

Pandas
Numpy
gc

Aim

file 1 - split_data_BRUTAL.ipynb
file 2 - split_data_NORMAL.ipynb
file 3 - split_data_BRUTAL.ipynb

OUTPUTS: BRUTAL_results.csv, NORMAL_results.csv, IMPUTE_results.csv
        1st row = # of columns
        2nd row = # of rows

Step-by-step usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Place the csv file from kaggle in the same directory as the 3 ipynb files
3. Run file 1, 2 and 3
